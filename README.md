# Problem 
Have you ever been to new place and felt overwhelmed or unsure of were to visit or eat. well then worry not Scoutr is here to help.
# Solution 
Scoutr encourages fun and efficient exploration of locations. Scoutr uses data from location and neighborhood then presents the user with a series of photos to swipe trough working much like the popular dating app Tindr. The app then builds a list of liked locations, from there users are able to get more details on a location, delete a location, and text the list to a friend. Users are also able to build categorized lists to serve a specific purpose, like  finding all the hotels in a particular neighborhood. They could also plan a day trip starting with a cafe, then going for a walk in the park, and ending the night over coctails.

## how it works
Scoutr is a decoupled application that uses React Native on the front end, and Rails 5 not the backend.
